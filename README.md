# project_management_via_git
A basic guideline (for newbie) on how to manage projects using github or bitbucket while working with a team

Let's know about some base things which will be use continuously-

** origin : "Origin" is the name of the remote repository where you want to publish your commits. Generally, it is the default name of the remote git repository you cloned from.
(More about origin: It is rather a local alias set as a key in place of the remote repository URL. ... Git has the concept of "remotes", which are simply URLs to other copies of your repository. When you clone another repository, git automatically creates a remote named "origin" and points to it.)

Example command: "git remote add origin https://github.com/something/something.git"
This will add origin. 

** upstream : If you fork 
** git clone : Used to clone (copy) a repository to local
** git pull : used to pull (download) from origin
** git push : 
** git commit -m '.....' :
** git checkout :
** git checkout -b :
